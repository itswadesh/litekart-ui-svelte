    <p class=" flex align-left mb-3">
      Mobile commerce, or mCommerce, refers to all types of transactions
      performed on mobile devices, including mobile banking, money transfers,
      and of course shopping! Since mobile devices are so popular for browsing
      the internet, it's only natural that users love to do their shopping on
      mobile, too.
    </p>
    However, eCommerce and mobile commerce are not exactly the same. While
    mCommerce is similar to eCommerce, it requires a different approach that
    online store owners need to follow to ensure that their eCommerce websites
    are fully optimized for the mobile experience. As an eCommerce business
    owner, understanding of mobile optimization is essential to your success.
